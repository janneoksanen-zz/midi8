# midi8
Arduino based DIY midi foot controller with 8 buttons and two expression pedals

This project is based on work done by individual who goes by the name Amplivibe on Thingverse and jackha on github. For my personal use this pedal controls a Legacy 3 amp head and a TC Electronic G-Major 2. 

I want to be able to do the following things with the pedal:
 * change amp channels
 * switch amp's reverb and boost on and off
 * change program patches on the G-Major 2
 * switch indivitual effects blocks on and off (modulation, reverb, delay)
 * control effect parameters with an expression pedal
